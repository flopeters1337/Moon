Alumnus from ULi√®ge (Belgium) in computer engineering with a specialisation in 
the "Intelligent Systems" branch.
My fields of interest are artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
and computer vision.
I also like to crack a joke from time to time so expect some serious and less 
serious posts.
