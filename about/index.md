Currently pursuing a Master's degree in computer engineering at ULi√®ge 
(Belgium) where I am following the "Intelligent Systems" specialisation.
My fields of interest are artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
and computer vision.
I also like to crack a joke from time to time so expect some serious and less 
serious posts.
